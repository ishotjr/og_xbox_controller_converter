- appears as a usb hub, wat
- I expected a HID
- ooooh the library is less libusb, more in-tree device driver compilation

- there's this whole ehci thing whoich defines mmio registers for accessing usb controllers

- eventually able to determine the hub device had another device attached, and that was the xbox controller

- whack on the shenzhen io ost
- wow arduino is so bad
- tried platformio https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/08/arduino-from-hobby-to-prof-p1/ but got random errors
- fake cmakelists.txt just to get clion working, then forward from .ino to cpp immediately
